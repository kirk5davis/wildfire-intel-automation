steps to build:

- created venv

- system packages flag = True in the venv config

- activated venv

- pip installed jinja2, subprocess32

- installed Chrome (pointed at binaries)

- copied "tcl" folder from python install "C:\Python27\ArcGISx6410.6\tcl" into the new venv folder
	- this fixed an error when Tkinter tries to be called from matplotlib in the venv set-up
